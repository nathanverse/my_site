  <p>A key-value store is a non-relational database. Each unique identifier is stored as a key with its associated value.</p>
<p>The key must be unique, either is a plaint text or hashed value. For performance reasons, a short key works better.</p>
<p>The value can be any types. It is treated as opaque object in key-value stores.</p>
<p>In this article, we will try to design:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of a key-value pair is small: less than 10 KB.</li>
<li>Ability to store big data.</li>
<li>High availability: The system responds quickly, even during failures.</li>
<li>High scalability: The system can be scaled to support large data set.</li>
<li>Automatic scaling: The addition/deletion of servers should be automatic based on traffic.</li>
<li>Tunable consistency.</li>
<li>Low latency.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="single-server-key-value-store">Single server key-value store</h1>
<p>Designing the database which is hosted on one server is easy, but it is very quick to run out of memory. Possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compressing data.</li>
<li>Store only frequently used data in memory and the rest on disk.</li>
</ol>
<p>But it is still not enough to handle big data access.</p>
<h1 id="distributed-key-value-store">Distributed key-value store.</h1>
<h2 id="cap-theorem">CAP theorem</h2>
<p>CAP theorem states it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more than two of these three
guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Consistency</em>: all users see the same data at the same time no matter what node they connect to.</li>
<li><em>Availability</em>: any client requests data should get a response even if some of the nodes are down.</li>
<li><em>Partition Tolerance</em>: the system continues to operate despite the system is partitioned due to network failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because in the real work, network failures always occur, thus the system that sacrifice this characteristic is impossible. Therefore, you
must either choose only consistency and availability.</p>
<p>For example, the following img illustrates the system with 3 nodes, and one node <code>n3</code> is going down.</p>
<p><img src="/my_site/cao.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>In this case, if you choose consistency (like financial system which emphasizes the importance of seeing latest balance). When latest
balance is written to <code>n3</code> but fails to propagate to other nodes before terminating, we can&rsquo;t write and read in other nodes, thereby
informing the service downtime and sacrificing availability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to preserve availability, <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> allows read and write operations to be executed despite the possibility of
returning stale or incorrect data. Writing operations would be reconciled later to achieve the correct state of the system.</p>
<p>You should discuss with the interviewer about what characteristic you should preserve.</p>
<h2 id="system-components">System components</h2>
<h1 id="handling-failures">Handling failures</h1>
<h2 id="failure-detection">Failure detection</h2>
<p>To know a node is down in a distributed system, several approaches are adopted. The obvious one may be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using a monitoring node</strong>: This node checks all worker nodes periodically to know whether they are down. However, this approach can lead to single
point of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast approach</strong>: Each node periodically sends <code>n-1</code> requests to the remaining servers. No single point of failure, but can lead to performance issue and
high network load.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the idea of multicast approach, we can realize that there is no need for each node to check all the remaining nodes. Instead, when a node has the
downtime information of a set of nodes in the cluster, another node can lend this information when communicating that node. This is what called gossip protocol.</p>
<p>Gossip protocol offers several benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced network load, high throughput</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>More reliable</strong>: For example, in multicast approach, a node may have network error with a particular node, this can lead to a false belief that that node has gone down
while it actually haven&rsquo;t. However, in gossip approach, we can know the availability information of a node through other paths.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="handling-temporary-failures">Handling temporary failures</h2>
<p>When a node goes down, our consensus mechanism based on read and write quora may be blocked, as we don&rsquo;t have enough nodes to acknowledge.</p>
<p>In this case, we can find a random healthy node to handle the acknowledgement. This node of course only handle the new writes and isn&rsquo;t replicated with history data.
Therefore, we need as fast as possible recover with a new instance if it is a permanent failure to ensure the configured replicating factors
, which guarantees fault tolerance, availability, and reliability of the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where anti-entropy approach comes in play. This approach uses Merkle tree to efficiently synchronize data on current alive replicas and roll up a new, up-to-date
replica to ensure replicating factor. Merkle tree allows you to detect the exact part of data in replicas that needs to synchronize, reducing network load and latency.</p>
<h2 id="handling-data-center-outage">Handling data center outage.</h2>
<p>It is important to store replicas across multiple data centers to minimize the risk of data loss and reduced availability.</p>
<h1 id="read-and-write-path-of-cassandra">Read and write path of Cassandra.</h1>
<ol>
<li>LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) as a data structure of the database.</li>
<li>The use of Bloom filter to detect if the data exists in SSTable, avoiding disk reads.</li>
</ol>
